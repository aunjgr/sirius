# Native embedding C API

Tracking: [MatrixOne #28966](https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone/issues/28966).
This is migration stage 3's control/library foundation. Stages 4-6 add the
bounded MO input, admitted TAE bindings, and native result adapters. The public
capability mask currently advertises **ENGINE_CONTROL only**. Query preparation
returns `SIRIUS_UNSUPPORTED`; this is not a working native SQL data path and must
not be substituted for Flight yet. Numeric compatibility is separately tracked
by [#28968](https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone/issues/28968).

## Build and link

Use Pixi and the existing native build. For example:

```sh
pixi run cmake --build build/upstream-dev-merge \
  --target sirius_embed sirius_c_smoke sirius_native_control_unittest -j 8
```

`Sirius::embed` links the bridge archive, static Sirius/DuckDB, the explicit
dummy extension loader, CUDA device-link objects and their native dependencies.
Do not link only `libsirius_embed.a` or a loadable DuckDB extension.

Building `sirius_c_smoke` also generates `extension/sirius/embedding-sdk`:

- `sirius_c.h`: C99-compatible ABI version 1, with no C++/DuckDB/cuDF includes;
- `link.json`: compiler and complete verified link arguments;
- `link.rsp`: compiler response file containing that link closure;
- `SiriusEmbedConfig.cmake`: an imported `Sirius::embed` target for CMake consumers.

The exporter obtains dependencies from the CMake/Ninja C-consumer link command,
not a manually duplicated library list. These are **build-tree artifacts** with
absolute paths tied to this Pixi/native generation. Relocatable MO runtime
packaging belongs to migration stage 7. Regenerate the SDK after native changes;
do not move the response file or reuse it with an unrelated toolchain.

An external CMake consumer uses `find_package(SiriusEmbed CONFIG REQUIRED)`,
sets its executable's linker language to CXX, and links `Sirius::embed`.
Point `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` at the generated SDK directory.

## Ownership and control

Initialize option/output structures with their actual `struct_size` and ABI
version. Create output handles must initially be NULL; a rejected create never
overwrites a live handle. Error storage is caller-owned and overwritten per
call; there is no shared last-error string.

Engine creation requires an explicit configuration path. The native worker
override defaults to two; values 1 through 128 are accepted. One native GPU
runtime owns the process at a time. A second native runtime cannot replace its
global GPU allocators. The embedding context disables automatic DuckDB extension
loading to avoid constructing a second Sirius runtime; required extensions are
loaded explicitly.

The coordinator initializes and destroys the runtime, and performs preparation,
execution and query teardown, on one native thread. Foreign callers never own
DuckDB's thread-affine execution-window mutex. Stop-token cancellation bypasses
the command queue; a queued query can be canceled while another query runs.

Admission permits one active query plus at most 16 waiters. The total live
handle count is bounded as well, including unprepared/unreleased handles. Each
plan is bounded to 16 MiB. Query deadlines cover preparation, waiting for start
and execution; the default is 15 minutes.

`prepare`/`wait` timing out does not implicitly cancel a query. `start` is
single-use. Retrieve the query outcome with `wait`; `close` reports whether
resource release succeeded. A quiesced query whose execution timed out is still
releasable. Engine close seals admission and cancels queries but returns BUSY
until callers close their query handles. Nonzero close results preserve the
handle for inspection/retry. Destroying a handle requires exclusive caller
ownership: concurrent calls using that handle must have returned first.

Fatal synchronization and unprovable cleanup are distinct from quiescence.
They seal admission, retain unsafe owners and return GPU_UNAVAILABLE. They
cannot be repaired by freeing buffers, resetting a shared device or reopening
the runtime in-process; the host must arrange fail-stop/restart.

Fatal GPU status is retained independently of the root's one-shot completion
promise. The query owner checks it after draining; an earlier completion/error
notification cannot make a poisoned runtime reusable. GPU workers notify this
owner rather than joining executor pools themselves.

## Buffer-credit primitive

`buffer_budget` enforces both byte and lease-count limits. It never grants an
oversized request as a deadlock escape. Credit remains charged after moving or
dequeueing a lease and returns only on final release. Leases keep their accounting
state alive after the facade closes. Closing wakes blocked acquisition and
removes scheduling callbacks; callbacks run outside the accounting lock.

This primitive is not yet a MO input queue or result sink. Those consumers must
carry its leases through actual asynchronous GPU use before enabling their
capability bits.

## Validation

```sh
pixi run build/upstream-dev-merge/extension/sirius/sirius_native_control_unittest \
  '[native_control],[native_credit]'
pixi run build/upstream-dev-merge/extension/sirius/sirius_c_smoke \
  test/cpp/scan/memory.yaml
pixi run build/upstream-dev-merge/extension/sirius/test/cpp/sirius_unittest \
  '[gpu_pipeline_task],[completion_handler],[sirius_ffi],[tae_scan]'
```

The control tests use deterministic private drivers, not a fake public SQL
implementation. They cover thread affinity, cancellation, capacity, failure,
deadline-versus-wait-timeout distinction, fatal owner retention and credit
lifetime. Fatal retention runs in a test-owned child process because process
death is deliberately its final cleanup owner. The C smoke test separately
proves real native linkage and GPU runtime creation/close.

The four-stage native round is not complete until a C caller can feed actual
MO inputs, run an admitted TAE query, drain bounded results, and cancel the full
data path. No SF10 or all-22 claim follows from these foundation tests.
